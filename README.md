# Instruction

To launch the game:
```bash
python3.12 aitris.py
```

# Games note

The game is the classic Tetris: pile up various shape until you reach the roff

In particular in this implementation:

![red_dot](img/red_dot.png)

The read square is the position decide by the AI

# Implementation

The AI is been develop with this type of reasoning:
- Find all the valid position in the empty board of the game
- Select the lowest position in the board (for all possible rotation of the Tetromino!)
- Prefer a rotation (for example with T we prefer the 180Â° rotation, always)
- After selecting a Tetromino and his rotation, find the column where it fits better or where it occupies the least amount of empty blocks below

### Example to fits better:

*Prefer* this:

![t_ok](img/t_ok.png)

_to this:_

![t_not_ok1](img/t_not_ok1.png)

_or this:_

![t_not_ok2](img/t_not_ok2.png)


### Example of occupies the least amount of empty blocks below:

*Prefer* this:

![cube_ok](img/cube_ok.png)

_to this:_

![cube_not_ok1](img/cube_not_ok1.png)

_or this:_

![cube_not_ok2](img/cube_not_ok2.png)
